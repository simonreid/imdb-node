The devastating results then have a transmogrification effect, his alter ego is released, and the Toxic Avenger is born, to deadly and comical results. The local mop boy is now the local Superhero, the saviour of corruption, thuggish bullies and indifference. Troma classic with good make-up effects and stunts, a pleasant surprise indeed.","languages":"English","country":"USA","awards":"1 nomination.","poster":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzViNmQ5MTYtMmI4Yy00N2Y2LTg4NWUtYWU3MThkMTVjNjk3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQxNzMzNDI@._V1_SX300.jpg","ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"6.2/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"68%"}],"metascore":"N/A","rating":"6.2","votes":"20,089","imdbid":"tt0090190","type":"movie","dvd":"10 Nov 1997","boxoffice":"N/A","production":"Troma","website":"N/A","response":"True","series":false,"imdburl":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0090190"}
